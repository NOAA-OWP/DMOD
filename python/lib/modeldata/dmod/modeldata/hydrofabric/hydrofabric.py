        Make the connections on both sides between this catchment and nexus.

        Set the connections for this catchment and nexus pair.  How the upstream/downstream relationship exists is
        indicated by another parameter.  E.g., if ``is_catchment_upstream`` is ``True``, then the catchment's
        ::attribute:`Catchment.outflow` property is set to this nexus, and the catchment is added to the nexus's
        ::attribute:`Nexus.contributing_catchments` tuple (or the tuple is created with the catchment placed in it).

        Other properties, in particular those on the other "side" of each entity from where the two are connected, are
        not altered.

        Note that, for ::class:`Nexus` properties, duplication is avoided, but otherwise the catchment will be added to
        a collection property (potentially with the collection object being created).  However, for ::class`Catchment`

        All implementations must implement a search routine that operates within the path specified by

        In the base implementation, a glob search is performed for ``**/catchment_data*.geojson`` under this data root.
        for each file that is found, a check for corresponding ``nexus_data*.geojson`` and ``crosswalk*.json`` files is
        done.  For this, all three files must have the same (potentially empty) substring for the ``*`` component of the
        file base name, and must be located within the same directory.  When all three exist, the catchment, nexus, and
        crosswalk files are saved into a files tuple in that order, and a callable to the

        Get the hydrofabric object for the given index.

        In the base implementation, this method creates and returns a new object on demand by using the stored

        See class description for details of instance collections of hydrofabric files tuples and callables.

        The ``discard_cached`` param is available, with a default value of ``False``.  If explicitly set to ``True``
        the function should discard any cached object for representing this hydrofabric before creating and returning a
        new object.  However, in the base type, there is no such caching, but subtypes should ensure this is honored.

        Keyword args are provided for future extensibility but not used in the base implementation.

        Parameters
        ----------
        hf_index : int
            The lookup index of the hydrofabric.
        discard_cached : bool
            Whether, if a cached hydrofabric object is saved already in the instance and available to be returned (not
            possible in base type, but may be for subtypes), it should be discarded and replaced with a newly created
