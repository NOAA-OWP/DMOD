        Get the subset starting from a particular catchment and going upstream.

        Function traverses the graph of Catchments and Nexuses, building a subset of the encountered features as it

        property and includes the downstream nexus for every valid catchment identified in the ``catchment_ids`` param.

        It is possible to restrict how many links away from the original catchment to proceed.  Each attribute
        traversal, whether ending up in a catchment or nexus, is considered an incremental link.  If ``None`` or a
