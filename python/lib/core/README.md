# About
Python package for core DMOD types, both concrete and abstract, that are depended upon by other DMOD Python packages and themselves have no dependencies outside of Python and its standard library.  

Classes belong here if placing them in a more specialized package would cause undesired consequences, such as circular dependencies or transitive dependency on otherwise unnecessary packages.
