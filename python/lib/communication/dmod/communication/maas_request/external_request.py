    def _check_class_compatible_for_equality(self, other: object) -> bool:
        """
        Check and return whether another object is of some class that is compatible for equality checking with the class
        of this instance, such that the class difference does not independently imply the other object and this instance
        are not equal.

        In the base implementation, the method returns True if and only if the class of the parameter object is equal to
        the class of the receiver object.

        Overriding implementations must always ensure the method returns True when the parameter has the same class
        value as the receiver object.

        Further, overriding implementations should ensure the method remains symmetric across implementations; i.e., for
        any objects x and y where both object have an implementation of this method as a member, then the following
        should always be True:

            x._check_class_compatible_for_equality(y) == y._check_class_compatible_for_equality(x)
