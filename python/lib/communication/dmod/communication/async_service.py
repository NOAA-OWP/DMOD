        Add a coroutine that will be run as a task in the main service event loop.

        Implementations may have a "built-in" task, which could potentially be executed via a call to
        ``run_until_complete()``.  This method gives the opportunity to schedule additional tasks, ensuring any are
        scheduled prior to any blocking caused by ``run_until_complete()``.  Tasks can also be added later if there is
        not blocking or it has finished.

        ----------
