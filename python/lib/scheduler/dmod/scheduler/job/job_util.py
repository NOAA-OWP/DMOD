    This default implementation is only aware of one particular concrete type that uses a Redis backend, so it will
    always return an instance of that type.  The supported keyword args are documented in the method.

        A de facto lock is implemented as the existence of a special key-value pair within the backing Redis store.  The

        attempt to acquire a new lock, thus ensuring the pair is only set if the key does not already exist.
