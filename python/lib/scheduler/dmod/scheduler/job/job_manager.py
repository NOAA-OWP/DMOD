        Implementations can decided whether a single or multiple queues should be produced, but they should clearly

        Implementations must return Python Lib/heapq.py type priority queues. Note that because this implementation is a

        a queue.  The first value in one of these tuples should be the additive inverse of the job's
        ::attribute:`Job.allocation_priority` value, with the job object itself being the second value.

        In cases multiple queues within a dictionary are returned, implemenations must ensure that each job within the
        parameter list is included in exactly one queue.  I.e., the sum of the length of all returned queues must be
        equal to the length of the provided argument list.

        Parameters
