# About
Python package for job monitoring for NWM MAAS.

# Structure
Structure has been modified from original to have inner duplicate directory in order to comply with general Python packaging structure.  This facilitates executing tests in a variety of different scenarios, including running integration tests on a local machine using the included test script and/or running unit tests directly within an IDE.
