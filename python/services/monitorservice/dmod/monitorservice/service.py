    """
    Core abstract class for monitor service, handling main service logic but abstracting connection details.

    The ::method:`exec_monitoring` method can be used to construct an async looping task to continuously monitor (in a
    poll/sleep manner) for changes.  Alternatively, ::method:`run_monitor_check` can run the logic for monitoring and
    queueing changes a single time.

    Connection details are abstracted, but certain things must be done by implementation when handling connections.
    First, details of opening connection and controlling what is monitored should be done over serialized
    ::class:`MetadataMessage` objects.  Actual changes should be communicated via serialized ::class:`UpdateMessage`
    object.

    When being established, a new connection needs to be associated with a unique identifier and set up for the
    ::method:`get_connection_object` method and ::attribute:`jobs_of_interest_by_connection` property.  The logic for
    much of this is provided in the ::method:`handle_connection_begin` function.  However, details for the actual
    connection and connection object are abstracted here, so that must be done by something else in subclasses (e.g.,
    a `listener` function).

    The initial `CONNECT` ::class:`MetadataMessage` may include an explicit group of jobs of interest.  This is done by
    including a config change entry keyed by the string returned by ::method:`get_jobs_of_interest_config_key`.  It must
    be a list of strings.  If the key is not present, all active jobs will be assumed to be of interest.

        Handle metadata communication protocol that occurs after updates are sent through a connection, returning

        Parameters
        ----------
        connection_id : str
            The connection identifier, as a string.

        Returns
        -------

            the connection should be closed.

        -------
        RuntimeError
            Raised if the message protocol is not followed as expected.
