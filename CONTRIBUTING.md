There are two primary ways to help:
 - Using the issue tracker, and
 - Changing the code-base.


## Using the issue tracker

Use the issue tracker to suggest feature requests, report bugs, and ask questions.
This is also a great way to connect with the developers of the project as well
as others who are interested in this solution.

Use the issue tracker to find ways to contribute. Find a bug or a feature, mention in
the issue that you will take on that effort, then follow the _Changing the code-base_
guidance below.


## Changing the code-base

Generally speaking, code changes required creation of a personal fork of this repository, committing those changes to the fork, and then submitting a pull request.  See the document on [Git usage](doc/GIT_USAGE.md) for more details.

New Python code should have associated unit tests whenever possible that validate implemented features and the presence or lack of defects.
