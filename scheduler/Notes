I can only see the containers launched on manager through "docker service create"
not the containers launched on worker1 and worker2

It seems that the "mounts" in services.create in scheduler.py conflicts with the "COPY" command
in /nwm/Dockerfile. "mounts" appear to overwrite everythng.
Need to comment out the two lines "mounts = mounts" in scheduler.py to be able to COPY
Also, the COPY operation seems to preserve the time stamp of the copied file

It seems that build order matters. The following build order produce the correct result.
Note that  the COPY operation preserve the time stamp of the copied file

$ docker build -t 127.0.0.1:5000/nwm-2.0 ./nwm
$ docker build -t 127.0.0.1:5000/mgmt ./scheduler
$ python3 -m unittest discover -v

Unittest and production run changes:
1. scheduler.py: local import
   scheduler.py: from scheduler.utils.clean import clean_keys (~line 785)
   scheduler.py: redis using local host or docker container
2. utils/clean.py: import scheduler.utils.keynamehelper as keynamehelper
3. request.py: local import
4. entry.sh: sudo python3 ...
5. keynamehelper.py: byte string to regular string
6. clean_redisKeys()

Need to comment out startJobs to see queued jobs as currently startJobs empties all jobs in the _jobQ
idx seems not used in fromRequest() method

Added code in clean_redisKeys():
        self.redis.flushdb()
        self.redis.flushall()    # clear Delete all the keys of all the existing databases, not just 
                                 # the currently selected one. This command never fails.

Check the possibility of cpus_alloc < 0

Why does it give me errors the first time I run the unit test after the maintainance?
The errors seeem related to Redis

Add memory allocation/check
