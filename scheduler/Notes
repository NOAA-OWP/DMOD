I can only see the containers launched on apd-dev1 through "docker service create"
not the containers launched on ucs2 and ucs3

It seems that the "mounts" in services.create in scheduler.py conflicts with the "COPY" command
in /nwm/Dockerfile. "mounts" appear to overwrite everythng.
Need to comment out the two lines "mounts = mounts" in scheduler.py to be able to COPY
Also, the COPY operation seems to preserve the time stamp of the copied file

It seems that build order matters. The following build order produce the correct result.
Note that  the COPY operation preserve the time stamp of the copied file
$ docker build -t 127.0.0.1:5000/nwm-2.0 ./nwm
$ docker build -t 127.0.0.1:5000/mgmt ./scheduler

Unittest and production run changes:
scheduler.py: local import
request.py: local import
entry.sh: sudo python3 ...
