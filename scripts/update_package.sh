Usage:
    ${NAME:?} -h|-help|--help
    ${NAME:?} [opts] [<directory>]

Options:
    --dependencies | -d
        Install Python dependency packages defined in the
        requirements.txt file in the project root

    --dependencies-only | -D
        Like the --dependencies option, except only do this
        step, without performing any other package building or
        updating

    --libraries-only | --no-service-packages | -l
        Include only library packages when default installing
        all local-source packages (ignored if single package
        directory is specified)

    --print-directories | -pd
        Do not install, but rather just print the directories
        of the local packages that will be installed (cannot be
        run with --dependencies, --dependencies-only, or
        --print-packages).

    --print-packages | -pp
        Print just the names of the packages to be installed,
        without actually installing (cannot be run with
        --print-directories).

    --venv <dir>
        Set the directory of the virtual environment to use.
        By default, the following directories will be checked,
        with the first apparently valid virtual env being used:
        - ./venv/
        - ./.venv/
        - ${SCRIPT_PARENT_DIR:-?}/venv/
        - ${SCRIPT_PARENT_DIR:-?}/.venv/
