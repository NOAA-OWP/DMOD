# About

This is essentially a dummy file used by the Dockerfile for the _ngen_ (and related) Docker images to enable copying a local Boost tar file from the local context when one is there without breaking the build when one isn't.  See the _download_boost_ build stage in [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile).

This file generally shouldn't change.  If it is changed, any build layers within the Docker build cache that rely on _download_boost_ (in particular the layers that actually compile the ngen executable) will be invalidated and rebuilt.
